Retrieve list of systems.
Read list of systems.
Create variable testParsed, testPassed= 0, testsFailed= 0;
For each system {

    retrieve listOfTest;
    assign listsTotal total number of tests
    testParsed is set to 0;

    While (testsParsed is less than listsTotal){
        Perform test

            if (test is successes)
                testsPassed increases by 1
            else
                testsFailed increases by 1
