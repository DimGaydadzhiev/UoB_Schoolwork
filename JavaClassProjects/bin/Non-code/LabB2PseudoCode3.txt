Create variable boxAmount, set total amount of boxes to it.
Create 2 arrays, bigBoxArray, sortedBoxArray- both the size of boxAmount;
Assign values in bigBoxArray.
Create variables ctr and ctrMajor- assign value 0 to them.
Create variables biggestBox and biggestBoxNum;

While (ctrMajor is less than boxAmount){
    
    iterate ctrMajor;

        While(ctr is less than boxAmount){

            iterate ctr;

                if(biggestBox is smaller than bigBoxArray[ctr]){

                        THEN biggestBox is bigBoxArray[ctr]
                        THEN biggestBoxNum is ctr
                }
        }

        set ctr to 0

        sortedBoxArray[ctrMajor] is equal to biggestBox;
        biggestBox is 0;
        bigBoxArray[biggestBoxNum] is 0;
