Java has signed bits.
The first bit dictates positive or negative number.

Conversion from Int to Byte just dumps the 1's and 0's into the byte, regardless of the sign.
So  255 converts to 11111111 = -1, because 127 is the max positive value, -1 is the max neg. value.
 01111111, i.e. 127 converts to 127.
